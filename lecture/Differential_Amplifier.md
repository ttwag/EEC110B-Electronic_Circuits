Differential Amplifier

* Non-zero differential input causes variation in output voltages and current.
* Zero differential input produces no variations.
* In a differential amplifier, the node at the line of symmetry won't change (AC ground).
* Has the same gain as that of the common emitter amplifier but consumes twice the power (2 BJT).
* The small signal model of the differential amplifier could be reduced to two identical half circuits that have the same gain. 
* The differential gain of the differential amplifier is the same as its half circuit.
* We can always ground the nodes shared by two half circuits in the line of symmetry.
